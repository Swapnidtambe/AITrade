The main reason for this is that the RBA minutes are coming out and there is renewed scrutiny on them.

However, we can analyze some relevant information from the news to make an informed assessment. The market is likely to open marginally lower, as indicated by the SGX Nifty, with a loss of 31 points. The BSE Sensex closed the previous session with a 195-point gain, while the Nifty50 formed a Doji candlestick pattern, indicating indecisiveness among buyers and sellers. The pivot point calculator suggests that Nifty may find support at 18,812, followed by 18,792 and 18,761. Resistance levels are identified at 18,873, 18,893, and 18,924. US markets experienced consecutive days of decline, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite showing weakness. European markets closed lower, influenced by higher-than-expected UK inflation data. Asian markets traded largely in the green, except for Australia\'s S&P/ASX 200, which saw a loss. The news does not provide specific information or events directly related to the banking sector or Bank Nifty. Based on this information, it seems that there is a mixed sentiment in the global markets, with some weakness observed in the US and European markets. The Asian markets, on the other hand, showed a positive trend. Given the lack of specific information regarding the banking sector, it is challenging to make a precise prediction for Bank Nifty.
